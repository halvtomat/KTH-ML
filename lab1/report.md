## Assignment 0
Dataset 1 and 2 both require at most 2 questions to classify a sample while dataset 3 require at most 3. Dataset 3 also contains noise which makes it harder.

## Assignment 1
MONK1:  1.0
MONK2:  0.957117428264771
MONK3:  0.9998061328047111

## Assignment 2
Uniform means all outcomes have similar probability.
Entropy is always going to be high in a uniform distribution, close to max (1.0).
Entropy in a non-uniform distribution can be anything but will always be lower than max (if it is max the distribution is uniform).

Examples: 
A coin flip or dice throw dataset should be uniform with an entropy close to 1.

On the contrary a flip or throw with a weighted coin or die would be non-uniform and have significantly lower entropy where more heavily weighted would result in lower entropy.

## Assignment 3
Gain	A1		A2		A3		A4		A5		A6
MONK1	0.0753	0.0058	0.0047	0.0263	0.287	0.0008
MONK2	0.0038	0.0025	0.0011	0.0157	0.0173	0.0062
MONK3	0.0071	0.2937	0.0008	0.0029	0.2559	0.0071

Based on the table above:
MONK1 should be split on A5.
MONK2 should be split on A5.
Monk3 should be split on A2.
